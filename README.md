# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance between two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Using import math function, do the calculation.
### Step 2: 
Take the coordinates as |1 and 2|
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4:
Using the print function, display the distance between the two points.
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:

import math
d1=[4,2]
d2=[10,6]
d=math.sqrt((d2[0]-d1[0])**2+(d2[1]-d1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```

### OUTPUT:
![distance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119393983/226554972-183c9a74-caee-4c93-8b99-13898b7930d6.png)

### RESULT:
Thus, a python program to find the distance between two 2 points using function concept is successfully executed and displayed.
